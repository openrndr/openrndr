# Contributing to OPENRNDR

## I have an issue or request

Before you file a new issue, take a quick look through
the [existing issues](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/issues) to make sure it isn't a known
problem. If you can't find anything relevant to your situation, just file a new issue and fill out
the issue form.

## I want to contribute code

While building the project is fairly trivial (detailed in the README),
more [complex build setups](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr/wiki/Building-OPENRNDR) are
possible to create even faster feedback loops as you'll be able to test your own changes to OPENRNDR
on your [openrndr-template](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr-template).

Feel free to ask for more advice
on [our forums or Slack](https://github.com/openrndr/openrndr#community).

### Style guide

The style guide is fairly minimal, but it helps to spell it out regardless.

#### Code

There currently isn't a strict style guide on the code, just try to follow the IntelliJ default
formatting for Kotlin.

#### Commit messages

It's preferable to make your commit messages relevant to the changes you make. Although it's not
unusual for the commits to be squashed when merging a pull request.
